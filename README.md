* Abstract
  * Mass incarceration is a large, but often hidden issue in the United States. The number of prisoners in the U.S. has increased drastically in the last few decades, and it is an important issue to understand so that we can start to solve the problem as we try to overcome systemic racism. Using the D3 library as well as techniques learned during 6.859: Iteractive Data Visualization, we constructed a scrollytelly website in order to visualize the makeup of the U.S. prison popula- tion, relying mostly on a dynamically updating matrix of humanoid icons. At the end of the narrative walk through, users are invited to both explore the data further as well as visit websites of various organizations trying to take action against mass incarceration.
